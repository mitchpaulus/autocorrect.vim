*autocorrect.vim*                                      *autocorrect*

Overview~

What makes this autocorrect plugin different than others? The difference is
that every single misspelling in this plugin has actually occurred by me in
practice. This is essentially a list of every misspelled word that I've had in
Vim over the last few years. As it turns out, there are many ways to mangle
some common words.

This list was not generated by any script. It doesn't just do common
transpositions, etc.

Basic Usage~

To load the autocorrect file, you can use the command ':AutocorrectTryLoad'. >

 :AutocorrectTryLoad

If you'd like to quickly add your own autocorrect entry to your personal
autocorrect file, you can use the mapping <leader>a.

By default, the file is stored in "~/.autocorrect". You can change the location
of this file by using the variable "g:AutocorrectPersonalFile". For example, you
could store it at >

 :let g:AutocorrectPersonalFile='C:/Users/mpaulus/mydir/filename.anyextension'

on a Windows machine, or >

 :let g:AutocorrectPersonalFile='~/mydir/samplefilename.anyextension'

The three main public functions that you can map to are: >

 <Plug>(AutocorrectTryLoad)
 <Plug>(AutocorrectForceLoad)
 <Plug>(AutocorrectAddToAbbrev)

If you want to change the mapping, you can do that by adding >

 nmap {yourmapping} <Plug>(AutocorrectTryLoad)

to your vimrc.

AutocorrectTryLoad and AutocorrectForceLoad are also available as ex commands,
like >

 :AutocorrectTryLoad
 :AutocorrectForceLoad

Loading automatically by filetype~

By default, the autocorrect entries are not loaded on startup. If you want
them to get loaded for specific filetypes, add a line similar to >

 let g:AutocorrectFiletypes = ["text","markdown","tex"]

to your vimrc.

How it works~

The main file is just a long list of iabbrev commands. Basically the plugin
adds a few helpful methods for adding to this file and choosing when to source
from it.

Contributing~

Inherently, this is a very personal project/plugin. It order to maintain it's
purity, I'm going to be the only one adding in new iabbrevs. But you can
expect this list to only grow and become more comprehensive as time goes on,
and it will continually be getting updated.
